# EdgeFlow — Domain-Specific Language for Edge AI Model Optimization and Deployment

## Project Overview

EdgeFlow is a minimalist, declarative programming language designed to simplify and automate the workflow of optimizing and deploying AI models to resource-constrained edge devices. By writing concise scripts, developers can specify quantization, pruning, target hardware, and deployment configurations that the DSL compiler will process into optimized models and deployment artifacts.

---

## Features (MVP)

- Declarative syntax for model source, quantization type, target device, and deployment path
- Unambiguous, easy-to-parse grammar using ANTLR
- Automated model quantization using TensorFlow Lite Converter
- Deployment automation script generation (e.g., SCP or device-specific package)
- Sample DSL scripts and example models for quick testing

---

## Tech Stack

- **ANTLR** for DSL lexer/parser and AST generation
- **Python 3.x** for compiler backend and deployment scripting
- **TensorFlow Lite Converter** APIs for model quantization
- SSH/SCP or similar for deployment automation to edge devices
- Raspberry Pi or emulator as initial target hardware

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Java JDK (required by ANTLR)
- `antlr4-python3-runtime` library (`pip install antlr4-python3-runtime`)
- TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite Converter (`pip install tensorflow`)
- SSH access/setup for target device (if deploying physically)

### Clone the Repository

git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/edge-ai-dsl.git>
cd edge-ai-dsl

### Generate the Parser with ANTLR

antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 -o parser grammar/EdgeAILang.g4

### Running the DSL Compiler

Currently, you can parse DSL scripts and trigger basic quantization:

python main.py examples/sample.dsl
