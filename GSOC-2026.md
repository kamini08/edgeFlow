# EdgeFlow: Google Summer of Code 2026 Project Ideas

# Add RISC-V and WebAssembly Backend Support

## Summary
Expand the compiler’s code generation capabilities to support open hardware and web-based environments.

This project focuses on writing new backend modules for the EdgeFlow compiler. The work involves translating the Intermediate Representation (IR) into compatible C++ code for RISC-V embedded targets and WebAssembly (WASM) modules, enabling browser-based inference and simulation.

# Implement Language Server Protocol (LSP) Support

## Summary
Develop a dedicated Language Server to provide a modern developer experience for the EdgeFlow DSL.

This project focuses on building developer tooling to reduce configuration errors. The work includes implementing the LSP specification to provide real-time syntax highlighting, code completion, and semantic diagnostics (e.g., detecting hardware mismatches), packaged within a VS Code extension.

# Implement Advanced IR Optimization Passes

## Summary
Harden the compiler by implementing standard optimization algorithms within the Intermediate Representation (IR).

This project focuses on improving the efficiency of the generated binary code. The work involves implementing graph-based algorithms for Dead Code Elimination (DCE), Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE), and Constant Folding to minimize model size and execution overhead.
